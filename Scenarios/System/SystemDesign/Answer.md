2. I have  to design the applicaiton, factors to consider:
    => Perfomance
    => Security
    => Being able to build more features without having to redesign the whole application.

3. Decide on which database to which will align with relational and non-relational data.
    => Use MongoDB for the non-relational database
    => Iser MySQL for the relational database

4. Develop application 
    => As team lead of the application I will decided on the framwork to use that will go hand in hand with the technologies I have chosen.
    => feature implementation, and also keep clients informed of the development, through sprints (Agile).
5. Since this application's data can be used to develop future services and improve exsting ones, then it can be incorporated into in-house CRM applications either for data analysis and/or for billing purposes.

6. Test the entire system thoroughly.
7. Publish application using serverless containers and phase-rollout until it reaches 100%.

8. Management will then have to decide on who will train the users of the system or do webinars of it.
